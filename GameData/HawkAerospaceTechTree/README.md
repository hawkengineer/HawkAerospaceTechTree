# HawkAerospaceTechTree

I have really enjoyed using the Skyhawk Science System tech tree for awhile but I wanted a tech tree that had some additional flexibility.  While SSS is a great tech tree, I wanted something that was not dependent on BDB (another great mod).  So I began this adventure in trying to create my own tech tree.  I like to acknowledge that the inspiration for this tech tree is based on the Skyhawk Science System mod created by CessnaSkyhawk.
